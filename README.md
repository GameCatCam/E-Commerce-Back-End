# E-Commerce Back End Challenge [![MIT license](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-blue.svg)](https://lbesson.mit-license.org/)

## Description

This project utilizes Sequelize and MySQL2, as well as other packages like dotenv and Express, to make the back end for an E-Commerce website. Models separate the data into Products, Categories, Tags, and ProductTags. You may create new data, pull up data, edit data, and delete data using an application such as Insomnia to make the various requests.
